README for chill.c 
Alex Wolf, July 2016


Compiling command:
 make


Execution: 
    As a parameter to the C file you can have temperature as the first parameter
   and wind as the second. If both of these were entered. If none were entered 
   print all chills from temp -10- 40 with wind of 5, 10 and 15. If only temp
   was entered prints all chills from for that temp for 5 10 and 15. If both were
   entered only compute chill for that wind and temp. 

   Wind must be less than 50 and wind must be greater than .5 for the program to execute.

  Assumptions:
    -Made no assumptions about the parameters given by the user
    	-Read errors on stopped function if inout was incorrect 
    -Made sure i was a digit, and that there were no more than 2.
