README for dog.c 
Alex Wolf, July 2016


Compiling Dog:
 make

Usage:
/* 
 * 
 * usage: read list of files and diapky on screen. Change charcters directed by -m -M and show line numbers with -n
 *
 *use - for file name to come from stardin 
 * Will read filenmae fromstdin in no filenames given
 * 
 * output:
 *   read the stdin, copying it to stdout, but wherever the 
 *   target text is found, replace it with the contents of the 
 *   replacement file.
 * stdin: the input template
 * stdout: the modified template
 * stderr: error messages

Execution: 
   *Paramerters*
        -include 3 possible options -n and -m and -M
   		 -n  means a number should be outputted to the left of each line
   		-m means says to decipher a files with a filename right after -m
   		-M is the same thing as -m for -M except it decodes from the mapfile instead of encode. 
      -make sure all options go before file names that should be entered after

    *Encoding file structure after option -m or -M*
    -Mapfile should have for each line a any ASCII char, then a space, then another ASCII char then a new line.
    -if both are letters must be the same case(both upper or both lower)
    -EX. a b'\n'

    For getting from stdIN
      -if no stdin was piped must type file name when shell script stops and hit enter
          -will print files listed before - on command line then pause script foyou to bring in std and hit enter

Example command lines:

  echo testfile2 | dog -n -M mapfile testfile - mapfile
  dog -
  dog -m mapfile -n testfile
  dog --help

Exit status:
  0 - success
  1 - incorrect number of arguments
  2 - incorrect mapfile format
  3 - cannot open replacement file
  4 - error during input

Errors:
  Will be primted out including line number in encoding file

  Assumptions:
  	Mapping chars from mapfile
   	-all ASCII charcters can pe passed in the mapfile no just letters
   	-Mapfile's last line has a \n after it
   	-*** SINCE INCLUDING ALL ASCII chars in encodings*** map file can be great than 26 lines

   	Calling -m or -M
   	--there is an input of stdIn or program won't execute

    Getting file name form stdin
    -the stdin is only one file
    - if no stdin the user while have type type it after the dog command and hit enter
